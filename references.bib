	abstract = {The human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) is an inducible epithelial peptide antibiotic that has potent antistaphylococcal activity. Infection of skin epithelial cells with viable Staphylococcus aureus, a common skin pathogen, induces increased gene expression of hBD-3 and other antimicrobial peptides. The aim of this study was to identify signaling pathways and nuclear responses that contribute to the gene expression of hBD-3 in primary human keratinocytes upon contact with S. aureus. Increased hBD-3 peptide was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy in keratinocytes exposed to S. aureus and to lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Both are ligands for the cell surface Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and thus the contribution of TLR2 signaling in hBD-3 expression was examined. Functional inhibition of TLR2 prior to S. aureus stimulation significantly decreased hBD-3 mRNA levels by 37\%, attesting to the involvement of this surface receptor in the initial recognition and downstream signaling for hBD-3 expression. Treatment of keratinocytes with a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor prior to either S. aureus or LTA stimulation was associated with reduced hBD-3 mRNA transcripts and peptide. We also propose a role for the MAPK-regulated transcriptional activating protein 1 in S. aureus-induced hBD-3 gene expression. Combined, these studies indicate a role for TLR2 signaling and MAPK activation in the upregulation of hBD-3 and demonstrate the innate immune capacity of skin keratinocytes under conditions of S. aureus challenge to enhance the local expression of this antistaphylococcal peptide antibiotic.},

Blocking S. aureus colonization may reduce the incidence of invasive infectious diseases; however, the mechanism whereby Esp disrupts biofilms is unknown. We show here that Esp cleaves autolysin (Atl)-derived murein hydrolases and prevents staphylococcal release of DNA, which serves as extracellular matrix in biofilms. The three-dimensional structure of Esp was revealed by x-ray crystallography and shown to be highly similar to that of S. aureus V8 (SspA). Both atl and sspA are necessary for biofilm formation, and purified SspA cleaves Atl-derived murein hydrolases. Thus, S. aureus biofilms are formed via the controlled secretion and proteolysis of autolysin, and this developmental program appears to be perturbed by the Esp protease of S. epidermidis.},

Such cultures would be superior in defined media to avoid interference with components of serum or tissue extracts. Here we demonstrate that a defined medium (supplemented keratinocyte defined medium) supports epidermal morphogenesis in organotypic cocultures equally well as serum-containing medium (mixture of Ham's F12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), as documented by hallmarks of the epidermal phenotype studied by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. In both cases regularly structured, orthokeratinized epithelia evolved with similar kinetics. Morphology in mixture of Ham's F12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was slightly hyperplastic, and keratins 1 and 10 synthesis less co-ordinated than in supplemented keratinocyte defined medium, but a consistently inverted sequence of expression of keratins 1 and 10 was found in either medium. The late differentiation markers filaggrin, involucrin, keratin 2e, and transglutaminase 1 corresponded in their typical distribution in upper suprabasal layers. Keratin 16 persisted under both conditions indicating the activated epidermal state. Keratinocyte proliferation was comparable in both media, whereas fibroblast multiplication and proliferation was delayed and reduced in supplemented keratinocyte defined medium. In both media, ultrastructural features of epidermal differentiation as well as reconstitution of a basement membrane occurred similarly. Immature lamellar bodies and cytoplasmatic vacuoles, however, indicated an impaired lipid metabolism in supplemented keratinocyte defined medium. Nevertheless, these defined organotypic cocultures provide a suitable basis for in vitro skin models to study molecular mechanisms of tissue homeostasis and for use in pharmacotoxicologic testing.},

	abstract = {Intact human epidermis resists invasion by pathogenic microbes but the biochemical basis of its resistance is not well understood. Recently, an antimicrobial peptide, human beta-defensin-2, was discovered in inflamed epidermis. We used a recombinant baculovirus/insect cell system to produce human beta-defensin-2 and confirmed that at micromolar concentrations it has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, with the striking exception of Staphylococcus aureus. Immunostaining with a polyclonal antibody to human beta-defensin-2 showed that the expression of human beta-defensin-2 peptide by human keratinocytes required differentiation of the cells (either by increased calcium concentration or by growth and maturation in epidermal organotypic culture) as well as a cytokine or bacterial stimulus. Interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-1beta, or live Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be the most effective stimuli whereas other bacteria and cytokines had little or no ability to induce human beta-defensin-2 synthesis. In interleukin-1alpha-stimulated epidermal cultures, human beta-defensin-2 first appeared in the cytoplasm in differentiated suprabasal layers of skin, next in a more peripheral web-like distribution in the upper layers of the epidermis, and then over a few days migrated to the stratum corneum. By semiquantitative Western blot analysis of epidermal lysates, the average concentration of human beta-defensin-2 in stimulated organotypic epidermal culture reached 15--70 microg per gram of tissue, i.e., 3.5-16 microM, well within the range required for antimicrobial activity. Because of the restricted pattern of human beta-defensin-2 distribution in the epidermis, its local concentration must be much higher. Defensins and other antimicrobial peptides of inflamed epidermis are likely to play an important antimicrobial role in host defense against cutaneous pathogens.},

We quantified S. aureus mRNA levels in nose swabs of persistent carriers to gain insight into the regulatory adaptation of the bacterium to the nasal environment. We could elucidate a general response of the pathogen to the surrounding milieu independent of the strain background or the human host. Colonizing bacteria preferentially express molecules necessary for tissue adherence or immune-evasion whereas toxins are down regulated. From the analysis of regulatory loci we found evidence for a predominate role of the essential two-component system WalKR of S. aureus. The results suggest that during persistent colonization the bacteria are metabolically active with a high cell surface turnover. The increased understanding of bacterial factors that maintain the colonization state can open new therapeutic options to control nasal carriage and subsequent infections.},

The membrane-perforating beta-barrel motif is a conserved attack element of cytolysins of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Following the recognition that nucleated cells can survive membrane permeabilization, a profile of abundant transcripts was obtained in transiently perforated keratinocytes. Several immediate early genes were found to be upregulated, reminiscent of the cellular response to growth factors. Cell cycle analyses revealed doubling of S + G2/M phase cells 26 h post toxin treatment. Determination of cell counts uncovered that after an initial drop, numbers increased to exceed the controls after 2 days. A non-lytic alpha-toxin mutant remained without effect. The alpha-toxin pore is too small to allow egress of cytosolic growth factors, and evidence was instead obtained for growth signalling via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Inhibition of the EGFR or of EGFR-proligand-processing blocked the mitogenic effect of alpha-toxin. Western blots with phospho-specific antibodies revealed activation of the EGFR, and of the adapter protein Shc. Immediate early response and proliferation upon transient plasma membrane pore formation by bacterial toxins may represent a novel facet of the complex interaction between pathogen and host.},

Here we have independently corroborated these findings in a widely used laboratory strain of S. aureus. Additionally, we have constructed a DNA cytosine methyltransferase mutant in the high-efficiency Escherichia coli cloning strain DH10B (called DC10B). Plasmids isolated from DC10B can be directly transformed into clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. We also show that the loss of restriction (both type I and IV) in an S. aureus USA300 strain does not have an impact on virulence. Circumventing the SauUSI restriction barrier, combined with an improved deletion and transformation protocol, has allowed the genetic manipulation of previously untransformable strains of these important opportunistic pathogens.
IMPORTANCE Staphylococcal infections place a huge burden on the health care sector due both to their severity and also to the economic impact of treating the infections because of prolonged hospitalization. To improve the understanding of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis infections, we have developed a series of improved techniques that allow the genetic manipulation of strains that were previously refractory to transformation. These developments will speed up the process of mutant construction and increase our understanding of these species as a whole, rather than just a small subset of strains that could previously be manipulated.},

Yeast cells had retained their viability and increased in number approximately twofold over a 4-day period of incubation. Yeast-to-hyphal transition was not achieved in this model.

Due to its widespread prevalence as an asymptomatic skin colonizer and its importance as a source of skin and soft tissue infections, an improved understanding of how S. aureus attaches to, grows within, and breaches the stratified layers of the epidermis is of critical importance. Three-dimensional organotypic human skin culture models are informative and tractable experimental systems for future investigations of the interactions between S. aureus and the multi-faceted skin tissue. We propose that S. aureus virulence factors, primarily appreciated for their role in pathogenesis of invasive infections, play alternative roles in promoting asymptomatic bacterial growth within the skin. Experimental manipulations of these cultures will provide insight into the many poorly understood molecular interactions occurring at the interface between S. aureus and stratified human skin tissue.},

The purposes of this paper are to provide guidance for preparation of a novel artificial sweat with chemical constituents at concentrations that match human sweat and to characterize chemical stability. The artificial sweat was characterized under conditions of use (with and without sebum at 36 °C) and storage (without sebum at −4, 4, and 23 °C) over 28 days by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, enzymatic assay kits, and ion-selective electrodes. Seven indicator constituents were tracked: sodium, chloride, glucose, lactic acid, urea, pantothenic acid, and alanine. With or without sebum at 36 °C, the sweat solvent was chemically stable for 14 days. Storage by refrigeration at 4 °C retained the chemical integrity of the solvent longest. Based on these results, the solvent should be used within 14 days of preparation. The artificial sweat model presented herein is most similar to human sweat and has applications as a dissolution solvent, donor solution in diffusion cells, or vehicle for patch testing. This sweat model may aid researchers in understanding potential release and percutaneous absorption of chemicals in contact with human skin surface liquids.},

The phenotypic properties included hemolytic activities, antibiotic resistance data, and the production of enterotoxins.

The eradication of the organism from the patient's skin is an important infection control strategy during epidemic and endemic episodes. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D), air-exposed human epidermal skin equivalent was exploited to study Acinetobacter skin colonization. We characterized the adherence of A. baumannii ATCC 19606T and Acinetobacter junii RUH2228T to and biofilm formation on the skin equivalent and the responses to these bacteria. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of the disinfectant chlorhexidine to decolonize the skin equivalents. The results revealed that both strains replicated on the stratum corneum for up to 72 h but did not invade the epidermis. A. baumannii, in contrast to A. junii, formed large biofilms on the stratum corneum. Bacterial colonization did not affect keratinocyte activation, proliferation, or differentiation, nor did it induce a strong inflammatory response. Disinfection with chlorhexidine solution resulted in complete eradication of A. baumannii from the skin, without detrimental effects. This 3D model is a promising tool to study skin colonization and to evaluate the effects of novel disinfectant and antimicrobial strategies.},

One such epidemic was caused by a clone known as phage-type 80/81, a penicillin-resistant strain that rose to world prominence in the late 1950s. The molecular underpinnings of the phage-type 80/81 outbreak have remained unknown for decades, nor is it understood why related S. aureus clones became epidemic in hospitals in the early 1990s. To better understand the molecular basis of these epidemics, we sequenced the genomes of eight S. aureus clinical isolates representative of the phage-type 80/81 clone, the Southwest Pacific clone [a community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clone], and contemporary S. aureus clones, all of which are genetically related and belong to the same clonal complex (CC30). Genome sequence analysis revealed that there was coincident divergence of these clones from a recent common ancestor, a finding that resolves controversy about the evolutionary history of the lineage. Notably, we identified nonsynonymous SNPs in genes encoding accessory gene regulator C (agrC) and alpha-hemolysin (hla)--molecules important for S. aureus virulence--that were present in virtually all contemporary CC30 hospital isolates tested. Compared with the phage-type 80/81 and Southwest Pacific clones, contemporary CC30 hospital isolates had reduced virulence in mouse infection models, the result of SNPs in agrC and hla. We conclude that agr and hla (along with penicillin resistance) were essential for world dominance of phage-type 80/81 S. aureus, whereas key SNPs in contemporary CC30 clones restrict these pathogens to hospital settings in which the host is typically compromised.},

Although the bifunctional nature of AtlA has long been recognized, most studies have focused on the combined functions of this protein in cell wall metabolism and biofilm development. In this study, we generated mutant derivatives of the clinical S. aureus isolate, UAMS-1, in which one or both of the AM and GL domains of AtlA have been deleted. Examination of these strains revealed that each mutant exhibited growth rates comparable to the parental strain, but showed clumping phenotypes and lysis profiles that were distinct from the parental strain and each other, suggesting distinct roles in cell wall metabolism. Given the known function of autolysis in the release of genomic DNA for use as a biofilm matrix molecule, we also tested the mutants in biofilm assays and found both AM and GL necessary for biofilm development. Furthermore, the use of enzymatically inactive point mutations revealed that both AM and GL must be catalytically active for S. aureus to form a biofilm. The results of this study provide insight into the relative contributions of AM and GL in S. aureus and demonstrate the contribution of Atl-mediated lysis in biofilm development.},

In a bacterial infection, biofilm-encased cells are protected from antibiotic therapy and host immune response, and these encased cells can develop into a chronic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is a prominent bacterial pathogen known to form biofilms on many medical implants and host tissues. In this report, we demonstrate that repression of the S. aureus quorum-sensing system is required to form a biofilm, and quorum-sensing reactivation in established biofilms disperses the cells. Genetic and molecular analysis demonstrates that quorum-sensing is activated before and required for the detachment mechanism. Detachment is protease-mediated, as established biofilms are sensitive to a non-specific protease and quorum-sensing activation increases the production of extracellular proteases. Using mutations in the protease genes, we show that these secreted enzymes are required for the detachment mechanism. These findings denote that S. aureus quorum-sensing can function as a dispersal mechanism to colonize new sites, and our results suggest this mechanism could be modulated to treat recalcitrant biofilms.},

We have developed a bilayered skin culture (SC) which forms a corneum 35 ± 1 cell layers thick 21 days after being raised to the air-liquid (A/L) interface. By the 7th day after raising to the A/L interface the corneocytes were irregularly shaped and had cross-sectional areas (CSA) of ≧300 Μm2. By the 21st day the corneocytes had assumed polygonal shapes and had a CSA (100–250 Μm2) similar to that of human foreskin. The total lipid (TL) content of the corneum averaged 5–7\% of the lyophilized weight. Ceramide content increased from 20\% of TL at day 7 of A/L interface culture to 30\% at day 21. Triglycerides decreased from 43\% to 17\% of TL during the same period. Free fatty acids comprised 5.5\% of TL at day 21 of A/L interface culture. The intercorneocyte spaces contained stacks of lipid lamellae. However, the stacks lacked the Landmann unit repeat. Abnormal lamellar structures were observed in both the intra- and extracorneocyte spaces. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was {\textgreater}4 mg/cm2 per h throughout the culture period. Lipid supplementation of the culture medium and culturing in a low humidity environment improved barrier function by 50\%. However, the effects were not additive. The SC developed a near-normal corneum, but did not achieve barrier competence, due at least partially to abnormalities in lipid composition and organization. Improvement of barrier function with lipid supplementation or low humidity indicates that modifications of the culture environment may facilitate the SC in assembling a permeability barrier equivalent to human skin.},

	abstract = {Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is an emerging contributor to biofilm-related infections. We recently reported that strains lacking sigma factor B (sigB) in the USA300 lineage of CA-MRSA are unable to develop a biofilm. Interestingly, when spent media from a USA300 sigB mutant was incubated with other S. aureus strains, biofilm formation was inhibited. Following fractionation and mass spectrometry analysis, the major anti-biofilm factor identified in the spent media was secreted thermonuclease (Nuc). Considering reports that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an important component of the biofilm matrix, we investigated the regulation and role of Nuc in USA300. The expression of the nuc gene was increased in a sigB mutant, repressed by glucose supplementation, and was unaffected by the agr quorum-sensing system. A FRET assay for Nuc activity was developed and confirmed the regulatory results. A USA300 nuc mutant was constructed and displayed an enhanced biofilm-forming capacity, and the nuc mutant also accumulated more high molecular weight eDNA than the WT and regulatory mutant strains. Inactivation of nuc in the USA300 sigB mutant background partially repaired the sigB biofilm-negative phenotype, suggesting that nuc expression contributes to the inability of the mutant to form biofilm. To test the generality of the nuc mutant biofilm phenotypes, the mutation was introduced into other S. aureus genetic backgrounds and similar increases in biofilm formation were observed. Finally, using multiple S. aureus strains and regulatory mutants, an inverse correlation between Nuc activity and biofilm formation was demonstrated. Altogether, our findings confirm the important role for eDNA in the S. aureus biofilm matrix and indicates Nuc is a regulator of biofilm formation.},

	abstract = {Biofilms cause significant problems in the environment and during the treatment of infections. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying biofilm formation are poorly understood. There is a particular lack of knowledge about biofilm maturation processes, such as biofilm structuring and detachment, which are deemed crucial for the maintenance of biofilm viability and the dissemination of cells from a biofilm. Here, we identify the phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) surfactant peptides as key biofilm structuring factors in the premier biofilm-forming pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. We provide evidence that all known PSM classes participate in structuring and detachment processes. Specifically, absence of PSMs in isogenic S. aureus psm deletion mutants led to strongly impaired formation of biofilm channels, abolishment of the characteristic waves of biofilm detachment and regrowth, and loss of control of biofilm expansion. In contrast, induced expression of psm loci in preformed biofilms promoted those processes. Furthermore, PSMs facilitated dissemination from an infected catheter in a mouse model of biofilm-associated infection. Moreover, formation of the biofilm structure was linked to strongly variable, quorum sensing-controlled PSM expression in biofilm microenvironments, whereas overall PSM production remained constant to ascertain biofilm homeostasis. Our study describes a mechanism of biofilm structuring in molecular detail, and the general principle (i.e., quorum-sensing controlled expression of surfactants) seems to be conserved in several bacteria, despite the divergence of the respective biofilm-structuring surfactants. These findings provide a deeper understanding of biofilm development processes, which represents an important basis for strategies to interfere with biofilm formation in the environment and human disease.},

Currently, there is a broad need to develop and improve our knowledge with regard to barrier function for reversal of mild skin irritation and dryness. However, there are few in vitro models that incorporate modulations of both lipids and epidermal differentiation programs for pre-clinical testing to aid in the understanding of barrier health.
We have generated a reconstituted epidermis on a decellularized dermis (DED) and characterized its barrier properties relative to human epidermis in order to determine its utility for modeling barrier formation and repair.
We followed the process of epidermal differentiation and barrier formation through immunocytochemistry and transcriptional profiling. We examined barrier functionality through measurements of surface pH, lipid composition, stratum corneum water content, and the ability to demonstrate topical dose-dependent exclusion of surfactant.
Transcriptional profiling of the epidermal model during its formation reveals temporal patterns of gene expression associated with processes regulating barrier function. The profiling is supported by gradual formation and maturation of a stratum corneum and expression of appropriate markers of epidermis development. The model displays a functional barrier and a water gradient between the stratum corneum and viable layers, as determined by confocal Raman spectroscopy. The stratum corneum layer displays a normal acidic pH and an appropriate composition of barrier lipids.
The epidermal model demonstrates its utility as an investigative tool for barrier health and provides a window into the transcriptional regulation of multiple aspects of barrier formation.},

This approach, in which the tissue specimen is optically sectioned, allows the study of changes in distribution pattern of applied compounds depending on the vehicle, time and depth without the interference of chemical alterations induced by most of the current techniques used for such studies. Using this technique the permeability properties of in-vitro-reconstructed epidermis were compared with those of the native counterpart. The epidermis was reconstructed by culturing human adult keratinocytes at the air-liquid interface either on fibroblast-populated collagen or on de-epidermized dermis. A fluorescent probe — Nile red (NR) — was applied in three different vehicles — polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a molecule mass of 400 (Da), propylene glycol (PG) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) — which perturb the SC barrier function to different extents. When NR was applied in PEG and PG on native epidermis, the amount of NR penetrating into and through the SC was very low, but was markedly increased when NR was applied in DMSO. Unlike native epidermis, the reconstructed epidermis allowed rapid NR penetration after the application in any of the solvents used. Furthermore, NR applied on reconstructed epidermis, was distributed quite homogeneously between the cellular and the intercellular spaces throughout the SC, suggesting that not only intercellular lipid structures but also the properties of the cornified envelopes differed markedly from those found in native epidermis. The differences in transport pathways between reconstructed and native epidermis may be partially ascribed to the culture conditions used, since incubation of freshly isolated epidermis under the same culture conditions as used for the reconstruction of the epidermis also leads to profound changes in the NR diffusion pathways.},

Eradication of notorious pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus from risk patients has become an important preventive strategy. However, efficient decolonization agents are rare, and the living conditions of colonizing pathogens have hardly been studied. Using a combined metabolomics and transcriptomics approach, we explored the metabolism of S. aureus during colonization of its preferred niche, the human nose. Based on nasal metabolite profiles, a synthetic nasal medium (SNM3) was composed, enabling steady growth of S. aureus but not of staphylococcal species preferentially colonizing the human skin. Marker gene expression was similar in SNM3 and the human nose, and genome-wide expression analysis revealed that amino acid biosynthesis, in particular that of methionine, is critical for S. aureus during colonization. An inhibitor of methionine biosynthesis had anti-staphylococcal activity in SNM3 but not in complex media, and transcription of the S. aureus target enzyme was strongly up-regulated in human noses. Furthermore, mutants defective in methionine biosynthesis exhibited strongly compromised nasal colonisation capacities in a cotton rat model. Altogether, our results indicate that the elucidation of in vivo metabolism of pathogens may lead to the identification of new antimicrobial targets and compounds.},

Bacteria were consistently detectable within the dermis and dermal adipose of normal human skin. Sequencing of DNA from dermis and dermal adipose tissue identified bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA reflective of a diverse and partially distinct microbial community in each skin compartment. These results show the microbiota extends within the dermis, therefore, enabling physical contact between bacteria and various cells below the basement membrane. These observations show that normal commensal bacterial communities directly communicate with the host in a tissue previously thought to be sterile.},

We recently reported that four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains formed biofilm independently of the icaADBC-encoded exopolysaccharide. Here, we report that MRSA biofilm development was promoted under mildly acidic growth conditions triggered by the addition of glucose to the growth medium. Loss of sortase, which anchors LPXTG-containing proteins to peptidoglycan, reduced the MRSA biofilm phenotype. Furthermore introduction of mutations in fnbA and fnbB, which encode the LPXTG-anchored multifunctional fibrinogen and fibronectin-binding proteins, FnBPA and FnBPB, reduced biofilm formation by several MRSA strains. However, these mutations had no effect on biofilm formation by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains. FnBP-promoted biofilm occurred at the level of intercellular accumulation and not primary attachment. Mutation of fnbA or fnbB alone did not substantially affect biofilm, and expression of either gene alone from a complementing plasmid in fnbA fnbB mutants restored biofilm formation. FnBP-promoted biofilm was dependent on the integrity of SarA but not through effects on fnbA or fnbB transcription. Using plasmid constructs lacking regions of FnBPA to complement an fnbAB mutant revealed that the A domain alone and not the domain required for fibronectin binding could promote biofilm. Additionally, an A-domain N304A substitution that abolished fibrinogen binding did not affect biofilm. These data identify a novel S. aureus biofilm phenotype promoted by FnBPA and FnBPB which is apparently independent of the known ligand-binding activities of these multifunctional surface proteins.},

Staphylococcus aureus is the major cause of surgical site infections, and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is increasingly accounting for infections worldwide. Preventing surgical site infections by screening and decolonising positive patients reduces the number of infections, but does not completely eradicate the risk. A balance between prevention, costs and the chance of mupirocin-resistant S. aureus needs to be evaluated and decolonisation strategies optimised. It is essential to know the site of S. aureus during colonisation. In this study, for the first time the exact location of S. aureus in the human nose was determined using a histological approach. We showed the presence of S. aureus in the cornified layer of squamous epithelium, associated keratin and mucous debris and within hair follicles in the vestibulum nasi. The presence of S. aureus in hair follicles suggests that this could be the niche from which relapses occur after decolonisation. Decolonisation strategies might have to be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the skin and mucosal surfaces of mammals. Persistent staphylococcal infections often involve surface-associated communities called biofilms. Here we report the discovery of a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis has revealed that these fibers have amyloid-like properties and consist of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). Mutants unable to produce PSMs were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Previous work has associated PSMs with biofilm disassembly, and we present data showing that soluble PSM peptides disperse biofilms while polymerized peptides do not. This work suggests the PSMs' aggregation into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms., Most people know Staphylococcus aureus as a highly infectious “Super Bug”, but many are not aware that S. aureus non-infectiously colonizes much of the population in the nose, among other bodily niches. It is not well understood how and why S. aureus is able to adapt and readily switch between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyle within the host; however, the capacity to accumulate into multicellular aggregates is a hallmark associated with both lifestyles. In this work, we demonstrate that S. aureus produces extracellular fibers in multicellular biofilm communities, and that these fibers help the bacterial community to withstand physical stresses. Surprisingly, these fibers consist of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) that have previously been implicated in biofilm disassembly and virulence. We demonstrate that accumulation of PSM peptides into fibers modulates their ability to disperse biofilms. Thus, PSMs fulfill dual and opposing roles that are modulated by amyloid-like aggregation. Staphylococci have never before been shown to produce this kind of extracellular structure, and our findings may have a profound impact on our understanding of S. aureus physiology. We have found that these structures are composed of known virulence factors, which indicates a common pathway between infectious and static lifestyles in the body.},

We studied the contribution of agr to biofilm development, and we examined agr-dependent transcription in biofilms. Under some conditions, disruption of agr expression had no discernible influence on biofilm formation, while under others it either inhibited or enhanced biofilm formation. Under those conditions where agr expression enhanced biofilm formation, biofilms of an agr signaling mutant were particularly sensitive to rifampin but not to oxacillin. Time lapse confocal scanning laser microscopy showed that, similar to the expression of an agr-independent fluorescent reporter, biofilm expression of an agr-dependent reporter was in patches within cell clusters and oscillated with time. In some cases, loss of fluorescence appeared to coincide with detachment of cells from the biofilm. Our studies indicate that the role of agr expression in biofilm development and behavior depends on environmental conditions. We also suggest that detachment of cells expressing agr from biofilms may have important clinical implications.},

The cloned gene, consisting of a 241-codon open reading frame containing the site of the transposon insertion, was recloned to an S. aureus vector, pSK265, and shown to be functional in S. aureus. Activity was evaluated by determinations of alpha-hemolysin, beta-hemolysin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 production in early-stationary-phase cultures. The cloned gene showed considerable variation with respect to different exoproteins and different host strains compared with the chromosomal agr determinant; this variation could not be attributed to the higher copy number of the cloned gene and probably reflects inapparent subtleties of the regulatory system.},

Expression of secreted proteins is up-regulated in the postexponential growth phase, whereas expression of surface proteins is down-regulated byagr. Theagr locus consists of two divergent operons, transcribed from neighboring but non-overlapping promoters, P2 and P3. The P2 operon sequence, reported here, contains 4 open reading frames,agr A, C, D, andB, of whichA andC appear to encode proteins of a classical 2-component signal transduction pathway. The P3 operon specifies a 0.5 kb transcript, RNA III, which is the actual effector of theagr response, and, incidentally, encodes theagr-regulated peptide δ-hemolysin. Transcriptional fusions have shown that both P2 and P3 areagr sensitive (function in anagr + but not in anagr background) and deletion analysis has shown that all four of the P2 ORFs are involved;agrA andagrC seem to be absolutely required for the transcriptional activation of theagr locus, whereasagrB andagrD seem to be partially required. Since transcription of P2 requires P2 operon products, the P2 operon is autocatalytic, and is thus admirably suited to the need for rapid production of exo-proteins at a time when overall growth is coming to a halt.},

	abstract = {Skin is the most common site of Staphylococcus aureus infection. While most of these infections are self-limited, recurrent infections are common. Keratinocytes and recruited immune cells participate in skin defense against infection. We postulated that S. aureus is able to adapt to the milieu within human keratinocytes to avoid keratinocyte-mediated clearance. From a collection of S. aureus isolated from chronically infected patients with atopic dermatitis, we noted 22\% had an agr mutant-like phenotype. Using several models of human skin infection, we demonstrate that toxin-deficient, agr mutants of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) USA300 are able to persist within keratinocytes by stimulating autophagy and evading caspase-1 and inflammasome activation. MRSA infection induced keratinocyte autophagy, as evidenced by galectin-8 and LC3 accumulation. Autophagy promoted the degradation of inflammasome components and facilitated staphylococcal survival. The recovery of more than 58\% agr or RNAIII mutants (P {\textless} 0.0001) of an inoculum of wild-type (WT) MRSA from within wortmannin-treated keratinocytes compared to control keratinocytes reflected the survival advantage for mutants no longer expressing agr-dependent toxins. Our results illustrate the dynamic interplay between S. aureus and keratinocytes that can result in the selection of mutants that have adapted specifically to evade keratinocyte-mediated clearance mechanisms.
IMPORTANCE Human skin is a major site of staphylococcal infection, and keratinocytes actively participate in eradication of these pathogens. We demonstrate that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is ingested by keratinocytes and activates caspase-1-mediated clearance through pyroptosis. Toxin-deficient MRSA mutants are selected within keratinocytes that fail to induce caspase-1 activity and keratinocyte-mediated clearance. These intracellular staphylococci induce autophagy that enhances their intracellular survival by diminishing inflammasome components. These findings suggest that S. aureus mutants, by exploiting autophagy, can persist within human keratinocytes.},

	abstract = {The primary attachment to polymer surfaces followed by accumulation in multilayered cell clusters leads to biofilm production of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is thought to contribute to virulence in biomaterial-related infections. We purified a specific polysaccharide antigen of biofilm-producing S. epidermidis 1457 and RP62A, which was recently shown to have a function in the accumulative phase of biofilm production by mediating intercellular adhesion (D. Mack, M. Nedelmann, A. Krokotsch, A. Schwarzkopf, J. Heesemann, and R. Laufs, Infect. Immun. 62:3244-3253, 1994). Following Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, this antigen was separated by Q-Sepharose chromatography into a major polysaccharide, polysaccharide I ({\textgreater} 80\%), which did not bind to Q-Sepharose, and a minor polysaccharide, polysaccharide II ({\textless} 20\%), which was moderately anionic. As shown by chemical analyses and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, polysaccharide I is a linear homoglycan of at least 130 beta-1,6-linked 2-deoxy-2-amino-D-glucopyranosyl residues. On average, 80 to 85\% of them are N acetylated; the rest are non-N-acetylating and positively charged. Chain cleavage by deamination with HNO2 revealed a more or less random distribution of the non-N-acetylated glucosaminyl residues, with some prevalence of glucosaminyl-rich sequences. Cation-exchange chromatography separated molecular species whose content of non-N-acetylated glucosaminyl residues varied between 2 and 26\%. Polysaccharide II is structurally related to polysaccharide I but has a lower content of non-N-acetylated D-glucosaminyl residues and contains phosphate and ester-linked succinate, rendering it anionic. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition with various monosaccharides revealed the beta-anomeric form and the acetylated amino group of the D-glucosaminyl residues as important for reactivity with the specific antiserum. The unbranched polysaccharide structure favors long-range contacts and interactions between polysaccharide strands and the cell wall and/or lectin-like proteins, leading to intercellular adhesion and biofilm accumulation. The structure of the polysaccharide is, so far, considered to be unique and, according to its function, is referred to as S. epidermidis polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA).},

To elucidate host–pathogen interactions pertaining to nasal carriage, we examined the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the colonization of human nasal epithelial cells (NEC) by a nasal carrier strain and a non-carrier strain of S. aureus. Using an organotypic model of the nasal epithelium, we observed that inoculation with a non-carrier strain of S. aureus induced production of IL-1 from NEC, but the expression of this cytokine was significantly reduced when NEC were inoculated with a carrier strain. Moreover, both IL-1α and IL-1β significantly decreased the growth of the nasal carrier strain of S. aureus (P{\textless} 0·001, n= 17 to n= 25); however the growth of the non-carrier strain was unaffected. Interestingly, it was found that several nasal carrier strains of S. aureus form quorum-dependent biofilms, which can be partially inhibited when preincubated with IL-1α. Taken together these data suggest that, although nasal carrier strains of S. aureus are sensitive to IL-1, they display a significant colonization advantage by both preventing the host from expressing IL-1 and elaborating a protective biofilm.},

Under high magnification, Lucifer Yellow appeared to lie within rather than between corneocytes of this layer. Control samples stained with Lucifer Yellow after sectioning showed no preferential binding of the dye in this region. We concluded that the localization of staining was the result of diffusion from the cut edge of the stratum corneum. Lucifer Yellow penetration was insensitive to PMSF, 1:10 phenanthroline, or N-ethyl maleimide and was also observed in an in vivo injury, indicating that it was not an artifact of proteolytic or degenerative changes. In contrast, horseradish peroxidase failed to penetrate, suggesting molecular size limitation to channel entry. Diffusion of Lucifer Yellow beneath the stratum corneum marks a pathway for the lateral movement of small molecules of potential importance in the normal physiology of the skin, drug delivery, and pathology.},

	abstract = {Nosocomial infections that result in the formation of biofilms on the surfaces of biomedical implants are a leading cause of sepsis and are often associated with colonization of the implants by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Biofilm formation is thought to require two sequential steps: adhesion of cells to a solid substrate followed by cell-cell adhesion, creating multiple layers of cells. Intercellular adhesion requires the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is composed of linear β-1,6-linked glucosaminylglycans and can be synthesized in vitro from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine by products of the intercellular adhesion (ica) locus. We have investigated a variety of Staphylococcus aureus strains and find that all strains tested contain the ica locus and that several can form biofilms in vitro. Sequence comparison with the S. epidermidis ica genes revealed 59 to 78\% amino acid identity. Deletion of the ica locus results in a loss of the ability to form biofilms, produce PIA, or mediate N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity in vitro. Cross-species hybridization experiments revealed the presence of icaA in several other Staphylococcus species, suggesting that cell-cell adhesion and the potential to form biofilms is conserved within this genus.},

The aim of the present study was to establish the presence of 52 proteins, including virulence factors such as alpha-toxin, during biofilm formation of five different (methicillin resistant)  S .  aureus  strains on Leiden human epidermal models (LEMs) and polystyrene surfaces (PS) using a competitive Luminex-based assay.       Results   All five  S .  aureus  strains formed biofilms on PS, whereas only three out of five strains formed biofilms on LEMs. Out of the 52 tested proteins, six functionally diverse proteins (ClfB, glucosaminidase, IsdA, IsaA, SACOL0688 and nuclease) were detected in biofilms of all strains on both PS and LEMs. At the same time, four toxins (alpha-toxin, gamma-hemolysin B and leukocidins D and E), two immune modulators (formyl peptide receptor-like inhibitory protein and Staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 1), and two other proteins (lipase and LytM) were detectable in biofilms by all five  S .  aureus  strains on LEMs, but not on PS. In contrast, fibronectin-binding protein B (FnbpB) was detectable in biofilms by all  S .  aureus  biofilms on PS, but not on LEMs. These data were largely confirmed by the results from proteomic and transcriptomic analyses and in case of alpha-toxin additionally by GFP-reporter technology.       Conclusion   Functionally diverse virulence factors of (methicillin-resistant)  S .  aureus  are present during biofilm formation on LEMs and PS. These results could aid in identifying novel targets for future treatment strategies against biofilm-associated infections.},

Bacteria could be seen easily on specimens from skin which had been occluded to increase the number of bacteria present. On the surface, bacteria were scattered widely in small colonies (usually containing less than ten bacteria). Although bacteria could be seen around the orifice of sweat ducts they did not preferentially favour these sites. Within the stratum corneum, bacteria could be found as relatively large colonies but these were usually associated with sweat ducts or the underside of the furrows in the skin surface. This study suggests that, in normal skin, bacteria are able to colonize both the surface and the depths of the stratum corneum.},

	abstract = {In this study we analyzed the expression patterns of loricrin in various species and tissues using immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and Northern blots. Loricrin is a glycine-, serine- and cysteine-rich protein expressed very late in epidermal differentiation in the granular layers of normal mouse and human epidermis. Later on in differentiation, loricrin becomes cross-linked as a major component into the cornified cell envelope by the formation of Nɛ -(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds. This process either occurs directly or by the intermediate accumulation in L-keratohyaline granules of mouse epidermis and human acrosyringia. Loricrin was identified in all mammalian species analyzed by virtue of its highly conserved carboxy-terminal sequences revealing an electric mobility of ∼60 kDa in rodents, rabbit and cow and of ∼35 kDa in lamb and human on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Loricrin is expressed in the granular layer of all mammalian orthokeratinizing epithelia tested including oral, esophageal and fore-stomach mucosa of rodents, tracheal squamous metaplasia of vitamin A deficient hamster and estrogen induced squamous vaginal epithelium of ovary ectomized rats. Loricrin is also expressed in a few parakeratinizing epithelia such as BBN [N-butyl-N-(4–hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine]-induced murine bladder carcinoma and a restricted subset of oral and single vaginal epithelial cells in higher mammals. Our results provide further evidence that the program of squamous differentiation in internal epithelia of the upper alimentary tract in rodents and higher mammals differ remarkably. In addition, we also have noted the distinct distribution patterns of human loricrin and involucrin, another major precursor protein of the cornified cell envelope.},

	abstract = {Subminimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics have been shown to induce bacterial biofilm formation. Few studies have investigated antibiotic-induced biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus, an important human pathogen. Our goal was to measure S. aureus biofilm formation in the presence of low levels of β-lactam antibiotics. Fifteen phylogenetically diverse methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strains were employed. Methicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, and cloxacillin were added to cultures at concentrations ranging from 0× to 1× MIC. Biofilm formation was measured in 96-well microtiter plates using a crystal violet binding assay. Autoaggregation was measured using a visual test tube settling assay. Extracellular DNA was quantitated using agarose gel electrophoresis. All four antibiotics induced biofilm formation in some strains. The amount of biofilm induction was as high as 10-fold and was inversely proportional to the amount of biofilm produced by the strain in the absence of antibiotics. MRSA strains of lineages USA300, USA400, and USA500 exhibited the highest levels of methicillin-induced biofilm induction. Biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase. Low-level methicillin also induced DNase-sensitive autoaggregation and extracellular DNA release. The biofilm induction phenotype was absent in a strain deficient in autolysin (atl). Our findings demonstrate that subminimal inhibitory concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics significantly induce autolysin-dependent extracellular DNA release and biofilm formation in some strains of S. aureus., The widespread use of antibiotics as growth promoters in agriculture may expose bacteria to low levels of the drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low levels of antibiotics on bacterial autoaggregation and biofilm formation, two processes that have been shown to foster genetic exchange and antibiotic resistance. We found that low levels of β-lactam antibiotics, a class commonly used in both clinical and agricultural settings, caused significant autoaggregation and biofilm formation by the important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Both processes were dependent on cell lysis and release of DNA into the environment. The effect was most pronounced among multidrug-resistant strains known as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These results may shed light on the recalcitrance of some bacterial infections to antibiotic treatment in clinical settings and the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in agricultural settings.},

Studies of the virulence of this bacterium are complicated by inconsistent results obtained in different animal models. We searched for an uncomplicated and inexpensive model suitable to study virulence of poultry strains of S. aureus using a genome-wide approach. We determined that a useful model would clearly differentiate strains of high and low virulence, and that this would generally correlate with the genetic relatedness among strains. To this end Gallus gallus (chicken) embryo and Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) models were selected, and their response to challenge by a set of well-characterized Staphylococcus strains was evaluated. The chicken embryo model allowed to determine variation in virulence among strains of poultry and human origin. The survival of embryos ranged from 0\% to almost 100\% for the various strains. In contrast, variation in virulence of most strains in the nematode model was comparable, regardless of their origin or genotype, demonstrating limited usefulness of this model. Most importantly, a clear correlation was found between the virulence level in the embryo model and the genotype of the tested poultry strains. Our findings indicate the potential usefulness of embryo model for future identification of host-specific adaptations and virulence factors in S. aureus.},

Exposure to wild-type, S. aureus bacteria or conditioned media killed airway epithelial cells within 1 day, while mutant S. aureus strains lacking alpha-toxin (hla) persisted on viable cells for at least 2 days. Recent S. aureus CC30 isolates are natural hla mutants, and we observed that these strains displayed reduced toxicity toward airway epithelial cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of known virulence factors showed the expression profile of S. aureus grown in co-culture correlates with results from previous human colonization studies. Microarray analysis indicated significant shifts in S. aureus physiology in the co-culture model toward lipid and amino acid metabolism.

	abstract = {Components of desmosomes, filaments, and keratohyaline granules were studied by electron microscope and biochemical methods to clarify their role in the stabilization and keratinization of the epidermis. Isolated desmosomes are composed of 76\% protein, 17\% carbohydrate, and 10\% lipid. The bulk of protein consists of a “spectrin”-like fibrous protein, presumably present in the plaque, and of glycoproteins in the desmosomal interspace. The main component of filaments, prekeratin, is a low-sulfur α-protein composed of a pair of three-chain subunits with non-α-helical segments separated by 200 Å-long α-helical regions. The major component of isolated keratohyaline granules, the amorphous particulate material, is formed by a high-sulfur protein with a single-type of polypeptide chain. polypeptide chains comparable to those found in prekeratin and keratohyaline granules were recovered from extracts of horny cells. Within the living part of the epidermis, filaments hypothetically form a cytoskeletal system which is anchored to desmosomes by a filamentous plaque protein. Glycoproteins are involved in the formation of strong junctions between the cells which enable the living part of the epidermis to respond as a whole to mechanical stress. The stratum corneum is stabilized by a similar system in a consolidated state which is less extensible. Horny cells are enveloped by a thickened membrane and the interfilamentous spaces are filled with various proteins, including the sulfur-rich amorphous protein found in keratohyaline granules.},

	abstract = {The penetration of two antibiotics, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, through biofilms developed in an in vitro model system was investigated. The susceptibilities of biofilms and corresponding freely suspended bacteria to killing by the antibiotics were also measured. Biofilms of Klebsiella pneumoniae were developed on microporous membranes resting on agar nutrient medium. The susceptibilities of planktonic cultures and biofilms to 10 times the MIC were determined. Antibiotic penetration through biofilms was measured by assaying the concentration of antibiotic that diffused through the biofilm to an overlying filter disk. Parallel experiments were performed with a mutant K. pneumoniae strain in which β-lactamase activity was eliminated. For wild-type K. pneumoniae grown in suspension culture, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin MICs were 500 and 0.18 μg/ml, respectively. The log reductions in the number of CFU of planktonic wild-type bacteria after 4 h of treatment at 10 times the MIC were 4.43 ± 0.33 and 4.14 ± 0.33 for ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Biofilms of the same strain were much less susceptible, yielding log reductions in the number of CFU of −0.06 ± 0.06 and 1.02 ± 0.04 for ampicillin and ciprofloxacin, respectively, for the same treatment. The number of CFU in the biofilms after 24 h of antibiotic exposure was not statistically different from the number after 4 h of treatment. Ampicillin did not penetrate wild-typeK. pneumoniae biofilms, whereas ciprofloxacin and a nonreactive tracer (chloride ion) penetrated the biofilms quickly. The concentration of ciprofloxacin reached the MIC throughout the biofilm within 20 min. Ampicillin penetrated biofilms formed by a β-lactamase-deficient mutant. However, the biofilms formed by this mutant were resistant to ampicillin treatment, exhibiting a 0.18 ± 0.07 log reduction in the number of CFU after 4 h of exposure and a 1.64 ± 0.33 log reduction in the number of CFU after 24 h of exposure. Poor penetration contributed to wild-type biofilm resistance to ampicillin but not to ciprofloxacin. The increased resistance of the wild-type strain to ciprofloxacin and the mutant strain to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin could not be accounted for by antibiotic inactivation or slow diffusion since these antibiotics fully penetrated the biofilms. These results suggest that some other resistance mechanism is involved for both agents.},

	abstract = {The Staphylococcus aureus cid and lrg operons are known to be involved in biofilm formation by controlling cell lysis and the release of genomic DNA, which ultimately becomes a structural component of the biofilm matrix. Although the molecular mechanisms controlling cell death and lysis are unknown, it has been hypothesized that the cidA and lrgA genes encode holin- and antiholin-like proteins and function to regulate these processes similarly to bacteriophage-induced death and lysis. In this study, we focused on the biochemical and molecular characterization of CidA and LrgA with the goal of testing the holin model. First, membrane fractionation and fluorescent protein fusion studies revealed that CidA and LrgA are membrane-associated proteins. Furthermore, similarly to holins, CidA and LrgA were found to oligomerize into high-molecular-mass complexes whose formation was dependent on disulfide bonds formed between cysteine residues. To determine the function of disulfide bond-dependent oligomerization of CidA, an S. aureus mutant in which the wild-type copy of the cidA gene was replaced with the cysteine mutant allele was generated. As determined by β-galactosidase release assays, this mutant exhibited increased cell lysis during stationary phase, suggesting that oligomerization has a negative impact on this process. When analyzed for biofilm development and maturation, this mutant displayed increased biofilm adhesion in a static assay and a greater amount of dead-cell accumulation during biofilm maturation. These studies support the model that CidA and LrgA proteins are bacterial holin-/antiholin-like proteins that function to control cell death and lysis during biofilm development.},

	abstract = {Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus involves the formation of an extracellular matrix, but the composition of this matrix has been uncertain. Here we report that the matrix is largely composed of cytoplasmic proteins that reversibly associate with the cell surface in a manner that depends on pH. We propose a model for biofilm formation in which cytoplasmic proteins are released from cells in stationary phase. These proteins associate with the cell surface in response to decreasing pH during biofilm formation. Rather than utilizing a dedicated matrix protein, S. aureus appears to recycle cytoplasmic proteins that moonlight as components of the extracellular matrix.
IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of multiantibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections and is often found growing as a biofilm in catheters and chronic wounds. Biofilm formation is an important pathogenicity strategy that enhances resistance to antimicrobials, thereby limiting treatment options and ultimately contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Cells in a biofilm are held together by an extracellular matrix that consists in whole or in part of protein, but the nature of the proteins in the S. aureus matrix is not well understood. Here we postulate that S. aureus recycles proteins from the cytoplasm to form the extracellular matrix. This strategy, of cytoplasmic proteins moonlighting as matrix proteins, could allow enhanced flexibility and adaptability for S. aureus in forming biofilms under infection conditions and could promote the formation of mixed-species biofilms in chronic wounds.},
